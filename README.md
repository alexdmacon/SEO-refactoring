# SEO-Refactoring-Horiseon

## Description and Goals
I refactored starter code for a fake marketing company's website homepage. 
My goals were to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of SEO and accessibility standards.
- Test my knowledge of HTML semantic structure.
- Learn more about making efficient CSS selectors.

## Semantic Structure and Style
 Among other things, I:
- Consolidated CSS selectors and properties.
- Added an ID element tag to fix a broken link in the nav bar.
- Added comments in the HTML and CSS stylesheet and labeled sections and articles.
- Made a clearer HTML semantic structure.

## Accessibility and SEO
To make the page better meet accessibility and SEO standards, I also:
- Added "alt" attributes to images.
- Gave the page a more descriptive title.

## Results
- The web page is live here: https://alexdmacon.github.io/SEO-refactoring/
- The repository is here: https://github.com/alexdmacon/SEO-refactoring
