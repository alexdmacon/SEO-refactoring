# SEO-Refactoring-Horiseon

## Description
I refactored starter code for the fake marketing company Horiseon's homepage. 
My goals were to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of SEO and accessibility standards by adding alt text attributes to images, a more descriptive title, and other changes.
- Test my knowledge of HTML semantic structure and learn more about efficient CSS use by consolidating selectors and properties and re-organizing certain parts of the code.
- Practice showing my work by leaving descriptive comments for other developers and for my own reference.
